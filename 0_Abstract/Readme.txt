# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract

*Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen.
*The wipers are now available in the front and back window  shields the of cars and many other automobiles.
*A wiper is made up of a metal arm with one end pivoting and the other end having a long rubber blade attached.
*The blade is swung back and forth across the glass, removing any water, any precipitation, or other obstructions to view.
*Previously, the wipers had to be activated manually by setting the frequency. The operation of increasing the 
 wiper speed is modified as a result.
*This is to improve the systems of older cars by providing automated transmission.
 wiping technology, to improve the system by including a sensor and actuator, and to develop a basic programme that would work with 
 the system completely.
*The principle of this proposed wiper system is similar to that of other existing conventional wipers.
 Regardless of the fact that To drain water from the windscreen, this system will be updated to an automatic control system using a
 Peripheral Interface.
*This project explains about the wiper control system by using the led,stm32 and arm based microcontroller.
