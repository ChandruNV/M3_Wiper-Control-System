#Working
This project works when the car is in start mode. The car starts or ignites when the user presses button and hold for 2 Seconds.
The user can make the wiper working by pressing the same button for 2nd time that was used to start the car. 
Again when the button is pressed for 3rd time wiper stops moving as per the users wish. 
When you press the button for the 4th time the car stops.


##Advantages
* Maintaining your windscreen wipers is important especially during the rainy season.
  This feature is responsible for keeping your windshield and rear windows free from water and other contaminants,
  giving you a good view of the road even during challenging conditions.
* Seeing clearly in rainy days can give people a sense of security and comfort.
* It can be easily and quickly installed in automobiles
* Low power consumption
* Simple and Portable
* Easy to implement
* Cost Effective


###Disadvantages
* The disadvantage is that the upper right corner of the windshield in the co driver's position can't be scraped,
  which may cause a blind area. Especially for the tall ones, there will be more on the upper half of the whole windshield 
  when the wiper sweeps. In this case, if there is a blind area in this area, it will be a bit irritable.
* It is totally dependent on timer circuit
* The cost performance of smooth scraping will be higher.
